# Bank-Management-System

This project is a command-line Bank Management System written in Python,
designed to simulate basic banking operations. Users can register, log in, and perform various account-related activities. 
I am providing you the text file and .ipynb file so that you can understand it in better manner.

Key features include:
User Registration and Login: New users can register, and existing users can securely log in to their accounts.
Account Transactions: Supports deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and account closure.
Multiple Users: The system can handle multiple user accounts, each stored in a text file for persistence.
File-Based Storage: All user data is saved in a structured text file, making it easy to maintain and retrieve information.

This project showcases practical use of Python concepts like file handling, data validation, and modular programming while providing a functional banking simulation.
