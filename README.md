# Bank-Management-System

This project is a command-line Bank Management System written in Python,
designed to simulate basic banking operations. Users can register, log in, and perform various account-related activities. 
I am providing you the text file in which whatever data is define by user can stored in text file directly and .ipynb file so that you can understand it in better manner.

Key features include:
User Registration and Login: New users can register, and existing users can securely log in to their accounts.
Account Transactions: Supports deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and account closure.
Multiple Users: The system can handle multiple user accounts, each stored in a text file for persistence.
File-Based Storage: All user data is saved in a structured text file, making it easy to maintain and retrieve information.

This project showcases practical use of Python concepts like file handling, data validation, and modular programming while providing a functional banking simulation.
